Hello Everyone,

As a guy who likes to self host everything from side project backends to multiple arr's for media hosting, it has always bugged me that for checking logs, starting containers etc. I had to open my laptop and ssh into the server. And while solutions like sshing from termux exist, it's really hard to do on a phone's screen.

Docker manager solves that. Docker Manager lets you manage your containers, images, networks, and volumes — right from your phone. Do whatever you could possibly want on your server from your phone all with beautiful Material UI. And it's completely FOSS!

You can get it on play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pavit.docker

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/theSoberSobber/Docker-Manager/ (Windows release also available here!)
